# Solution to Lab 3

by Dmitry Beresnev <d.beresnev@innopolis.university>

## Task 1

**Key Concepts Observed:**

- **Workflows** are the automated processes defined in YAML files inside `.github/workflows` directory, triggered by specific events
- **Events** are activities that trigger a workflow, such as a `push` and `pull_request`
- **Jobs** are a set of steps that execute on the same runner. Several jobs can run sequentially or in parallel. Job consists of individual tasks - **steps**
- **Workflow File Location:** Workflow files must be stored in the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.

**Followed steps:**

1. Created `github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` file
2. Put the content of template described [in this link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow#defining-inputs-for-manually-triggered-workflows) in the created file
3. Pushed the changes

**Observations:**

- After pushing to `lab3` branch, the workflow triggered automatically
- The workflows are listed in the actions tab
- From the logs it is seen that all the github variables are correctly substituted (like `github.event_name` and `github.actor`)

- Upon pushing a commit to the `main` branch, the workflow triggered automatically as expected.
- In the "Actions" tab of the repository, I could see the workflow run listed.
- Clicking on the workflow run showed the job(s) defined.
- Expanding the job showed the individual steps and their logs.

**Output of workflow:**

## Task 2

### 1. Configure a Manual Trigger

I enabled manual triggering of the workflow by adding the `workflow_dispatch` event to the `on:` section.

**Changes of `github-actions-demo.yml`:**

```diff
- on: [push]
+ on:
+  push:
+  workflow_dispatch:
```

However, the "Run workflow" button did not appear. To fix it, I added this workflow in the `master` branch and then merge it to the `lab3` branch (according to [this answer](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/58022#discussioncomment-8716372)).

### 2. Gather System Information

To gather system information I have added the new job to `github-actions-demo.yml` file:

```yaml
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions: ...

  Gather-Runner-Information:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Runner OS information
        run: uname -a
      - name: Hardware specification
        run: |
          echo "CPU info:"
          lscpu
          echo ""
          echo "Memory info:"
          free -m
          echo ""
          echo "Disk info:"
          df -h
      - name: Other runner details
        run: |
          echo "Runner Name: $RUNNER_NAME"
          echo "Runner OS: $RUNNER_OS"
          echo "Runner Arch: $RUNNER_ARCH"
          echo "Workflow: $GITHUB_WORKFLOW"
          echo "Actor: $GITHUB_ACTOR"
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

After the push, the workflow job `Gather-Runner-Information` outputs the following:

```bash
